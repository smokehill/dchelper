# dchelp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/blues911/dchelp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/blues911/dchelp)

Console tool for managing docker-compose projects.

Capabilities:
- list projects
- up and down project
- reset all active projects
- live mode
- common statistics

> The common idea of this tool is to simplify `up` and `down` actions with `docker-compose` and it doesn't track a real state of the project containers. So in any confusing situation when project id is cached but containers aren't running use `--reset` option to clear all docker units.
